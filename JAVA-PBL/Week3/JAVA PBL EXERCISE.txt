Write a program to create a Circle class with the following members
Point p;//Point class contains two members double x,y;
double r;
String color;
Date dateCreated;//check Date API
//methods
Constructors (private and public)
Functional Methods
	//calcArea()
	//calcPeri()
	//int compareTwoCircles(Circle c)
		Returns 0 - overlap
		Returns 1 - touch externally
		Returns 2 - disjoint externally
		Returns -1 - touch internally
		Returns -2 - disjoint internally
Circle implements an interface called Comparable
Go through Comparable interface API and implement body of the method compareTo()
	//write the body for compareTo()
	//logic is Circles are compared based on their area
//Class CircleCollection
//members - Circle[]
sort circles in the Array based on increasing order of areas (Arrays.sort(), Collections.sort())
